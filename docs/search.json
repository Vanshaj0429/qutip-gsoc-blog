Meeting Alex Pitchford, Neill Lambert, and Simon Cross was both exciting and slightly nerve-wracking!\nThe team was incredibly welcoming and provided great insights into the QuTiP ecosystem. We had an in-depth discussion about the technical approach for the Hamiltonian Library, covering several key areas:\nTechnical Architecture: We discussed keeping the class hierarchy simple and clean, focusing on usability over complexity. The team emphasized the importance of identifying common patterns and similarities between different quantum models to create a coherent and intuitive API.\nResearch Foundation: There was strong agreement on the need to thoroughly research existing literature for different quantum models to ensure our implementations are both accurate and comprehensive. Starting with well-established models like the Jaynes-Cummings model and various spin models would provide a solid foundation before expanding to more complex systems.\nPortability Considerations: An interesting discussion emerged around inter-portability of the library. While Simon and Alex advocated for maximizing cross-platform compatibility, Eric had earlier suggested to them to focus only on Python implementation initially. This highlighted the balance between ambition and practical delivery that’s crucial for GSoC projects.\nProject Scope: The team helped me understand that starting with core models and seeing where the project naturally evolves would be more valuable than trying to implement everything at once. This iterative approach would allow for better testing and refinement of the library’s design.\nWhat struck me most was how collaborative and open the discussion was - they genuinely wanted to understand my vision for the project while sharing their deep expertise in quantum simulation."

This proved invaluable for contributing to a project with multiple maintainers.\nTesting with pytest: Since robust testing would be crucial for a scientific computing library, I spent some time on some pytest features including parameterized tests, and testing strategies for numerical code.\nI also dedicated some time to familiarizing myself with the QuTiP ecosystem, diving into qutip-qip and working through qutip-tutorials to understand the current state of quantum simulation tools and identify where my Hamiltonian Library would fit most naturally."

    "section": "Team Meeting Insights (June 3rd)",
    "text": "Team Meeting Insights (June 3rd)\nOur Tuesday meeting with the QuTiP team was incredibly productive, covering several key decisions that will shape the entire project:\n\nBase Class vs. Model Specific Design\nOne of the biggest questions we tackled was whether to create a simple base class for basic Hamiltonian structure or develop model specific base classes. After discussion, we decided on a model specific approach where each quantum system (like Jaynes-Cummings) gets its own class with standardized methods.\nFor example, a Jaynes_Cummings or JCM class would include:\n\n__init__() for parameter initialization\nbuild_hamiltonian() for constructing the quantum operators\nbuild_collapse_operators() for dissipation and decoherence\nto_json() for serialization\nto_latex() for mathematical representation\n\nThe parameters and time dependent parameters would be handled in the __init__ method, while the actual operators, Hamiltonian, and collapse operators are constructed in their respective build methods.\n\n\nBuilding Complete Quantum Systems\nThere was a suggestion made by the mentors that expanded my understanding of the project scope, we’re not just building isolated Hamiltonians, but complete quantum systems that include:\n\nCoherent dynamics: The Hamiltonian evolution\nIncoherent dynamics: Collapse operators for dissipation, decoherence, and environmental effects\nSystem evolution: Ready to use setups for solving the master equation\n\nThis means each model will provide everything needed to simulate realistic open quantum systems using QuTiP’s Lindblad master equation solver.\n\n\nThe JSON Serialization Challenge\nThe to_json method emerged as one of the trickier aspects of the project. As noted in our discussion with Neill and Eric, serializing quantum operators and complex mathematical objects isn’t straightforward. The static data can be represented in a JSON, but it’s dynamical aspects that seems concerning. Though this is something we decided to tackle when the time comes.\n\n\nFunctions vs. Classes Debate\nWe also discussed whether to use class based structures or simple functions. The consensus was that functions might actually be more user friendly for reusability, users can easily copy and paste function calls and modify parameters as needed. However, I personally feel classes provide better structure for the JSON serialization requirements and managing both Hamiltonians and collapse operators together.\n\n\nRepository Strategy\nFor now, I’ll be starting development in my own repository until we decide whether this becomes part of QuTiP core or remains a separate package. This gives us flexibility to experiment with the architecture."

    "section": "Understanding Open Quantum Systems: Why They Matter",
    "text": "Understanding Open Quantum Systems: Why They Matter\nBefore diving into specific models like Jaynes-Cummings, it’s helpful to understand a little bit about open quantum systems and why it is important simulating these open systems. Well, all of it comes down to a fundamental reality: real quantum systems are never truly isolated.\n\nThe Idealized vs. Real World\nIn introductory quantum mechanics courses, we often work with closed systems described by the Schrödinger equation:\ni\\hbar \\frac{d|\\psi\\rangle}{dt} = H |\\psi\\rangle\nThis assumes our quantum system exists in perfect isolation, with no external influences. While mathematically elegant, this is rarely realistic. Every quantum system, whether it’s an atom in a laser field, a qubit in a quantum computer, or photons in an optical cavity, interacts with its environment.\n\n\nWhat Makes a System “Open”?\nAn open quantum system is one that exchanges energy, information, or particles with its surroundings. These environmental interactions lead to:\n\nDecoherence: Loss of quantum phase relationships\nDissipation: Energy loss to the environment\n\nNoise: Random fluctuations that affect system dynamics\nIrreversibility: The system’s evolution becomes non-unitary\n\n\n\nThe Master Equation Approach\nTo handle these effects, we use the Lindblad master equation for the density matrix \\rho:\n\\frac{d\\rho}{dt} = -i[H, \\rho] + \\sum_i \\left(C_i \\rho C_i^\\dagger - \\frac{1}{2}\\{C_i^\\dagger C_i, \\rho\\}\\right)\nHere:\n\nH is the system Hamiltonian\n\\rho is the density matrix of the system\nC_i are collapse operators describing environmental effects\nThe first term gives unitary evolution, the second term adds dissipation\n\n\n\nCommon Types of Environmental Effects\nDifferent quantum systems experience characteristic environmental interactions:\n\nSpontaneous emission: Atoms lose energy by emitting photons\nCavity decay: Photons leak out of imperfect mirrors\nDephasing: Phase relationships decay without energy loss\nThermal noise: Environmental temperature causes random excitations\n1/f noise: Low frequency fluctuations in system parameters\n\nReal experiments always involve environmental effects. A cavity has photon leakage, atoms undergo spontaneous emission, and qubits experience dephasing. Accounting for the right external factors influencing the dynamics of quantum systems is an area of active research. Knowing the right combination of these factors in a give situtation helps modelling and simulating the quantum systems more realistically."

    "text": "Introducing Spin Chain Physics\nWeek 7’s major physics expansion was implementing linear spin chains - a fundamental model in condensed matter and quantum many-body physics. These systems describe chains of interacting spin-1/2 particles and serve as the theoretical foundation for understanding magnetic materials, quantum phase transitions, and many-body entanglement.\n\nThe Physical Models\nOur implementation supports four canonical spin models, each representing different physical systems and regimes:\nHeisenberg Model: The most general isotropic case:\nH = J \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} \\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j = J \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} (S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y + S_i^z S_j^z)\nThis model describes systems where the spin-spin interaction is the same in all directions, such as many transition metal compounds. It exhibits rich quantum behavior including quantum criticality and is exactly solvable in one dimension via the Bethe ansatz. The ground state properties depend crucially on whether the coupling J is ferromagnetic (J &lt; 0) or antiferromagnetic (J &gt; 0).\nXXZ Model: Anisotropic interactions with controllable Z-coupling:\nH = J \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} (S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y) + J_z \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} S_i^z S_j^z\nThe XXZ model interpolates between different physical regimes by varying the anisotropy parameter \\Delta = J_z/J. For \\Delta &lt; 1, the system is in the gapless XY-like phase; for \\Delta &gt; 1, it exhibits Ising-like behavior with gapped excitations. At \\Delta = 1, it reduces to the isotropic Heisenberg model. This model is particularly relevant for describing magnetic materials with crystal field effects.\nXY Model: In-plane interactions only:\nH = J \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} (S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y)\nThe XY model neglects Z-interactions entirely, making it exactly solvable via Jordan-Wigner transformation to free fermions. It exhibits a quantum phase transition at zero temperature and is the paradigmatic example of a system with algebraic correlations. This model appears in the study of superconductivity (via the XY model of quantum rotors) and quantum magnetism in systems with strong easy-plane anisotropy.\nIsing Model: Classical-like Z-interactions:\nH = J \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} S_i^z S_j^z\nThe transverse-field Ising model (when combined with a B_x field) is perhaps the most studied quantum many-body system, serving as the canonical example of a quantum phase transition. In the pure Ising form, the model is classical and exactly solvable, but becomes quantum when transverse fields are applied.\n\n\nSystem Parameters\nThe implementation includes comprehensive parameter control for realistic modeling:\n\nCoupling Parameters: J (XY coupling strength) and J_z (Z coupling) allow fine-tuning of the magnetic interactions. The ratio J_z/J determines the anisotropy and phase behavior.\nExternal Fields: Magnetic fields B_x, B_y, and B_z represent laboratory-controllable external fields. A transverse field (B_x or B_y) can drive quantum phase transitions, while a longitudinal field (B_z) breaks Z-symmetry.\nBoundary Conditions: Open chains model finite systems with edge effects, while periodic boundary conditions eliminate edge states and better approximate bulk properties of infinite systems.\n\n\n\nOpen System Dynamics and Collapse Operators\nReal quantum magnetic systems inevitably couple to their environment, requiring open system treatment. Our implementation includes several physically motivated dissipation channels:\n\nSpontaneous Emission (\\gamma_{relaxation}): Each spin can decay from excited (|\\uparrow\\rangle) to ground (|\\downarrow\\rangle) state via coupling to a vacuum bath. The collapse operators are \\sqrt{\\gamma_{relaxation}} \\sigma_i^- for each site i.\nPure Dephasing (\\gamma_{dephasing}): Random fluctuations destroy phase coherence without changing populations. This appears as \\sqrt{\\gamma_{dephasing}} \\sigma_i^z collapse operators, representing fluctuating magnetic fields.\nDepolarizing Channel (\\gamma_{depolarizing}): Complete randomization of individual spins through \\sqrt{\\gamma_{depolarizing}/3}(\\sigma_i^x + \\sigma_i^y + \\sigma_i^z) operators. This models strong coupling to a structureless environment.\n\nThese dissipation mechanisms enable modeling of realistic decoherence in quantum magnetic materials, trapped ion chains, and superconducting qubit arrays - all of which can be mapped to effective spin chain models."

The factory function approach proved practical - both Jaynes-Cummings and spin chains follow the same pattern while handling very different physics. When implementing spin chains required no changes to the QuantumSystem class, it confirmed we’d found a reasonable abstraction level.\nWorking with spin chains highlighted the scaling differences between quantum systems. The Jaynes-Cummings model has a manageable 2×N dimensional Hilbert space, while spin chains grow as 2^N. This made parameter validation and system size warnings more important than I initially realized.\nThe biggest lesson was that studying QuTiP’s existing patterns (like how qt.basis() and qt.coherent() work) led to better design choices than trying to impose new abstractions. Our factory functions now feel consistent with QuTiP’s ecosystem rather than foreign to it.\nWith the architecture validated across different physics domains, the remaining weeks can focus on expanding the quantum model library rather than fundamental design questions. The pattern works, and adding new models should be straightforward."

    "text": "Key Project Decisions (June 12th Meeting)\nOur Thursday meeting with Eric, Alex, Neill, and myself covered several pivotal decisions that will shape the project’s trajectory:\n\nTimeline Extension Request\nOne of the most significant developments was the decision to request a timeline extension from 12 to 16 weeks. Alex will be reaching out to NumFOCUS to make this request official. This extension is particularly valuable given that I have summer schools scheduled for June 15-20 and August 18-September 5, which will impact my availability during those periods.\nThe extra 4 weeks will allow for:\n\nMore thorough development and testing of the quantum systems library\nBetter integration with QuTiP core\nComprehensive documentation and examples\nBuffer time for unexpected challenges (like the JSON serialization complexities we discussed)\n\n\n\nJSON Format: Parking the Complexity\nAfter extensive discussion, the team decided to park the agnostic format (JSON) requirement for now. As noted in the meeting, “not everyone is convinced of the value for this” and “it is not necessary to get started.” This is actually a relief, it allows us to focus on building solid, functional quantum systems first, and we can always add serialization capabilities later if there’s demand.\nThis decision simplifies the immediate development path significantly and lets us concentrate on the core physics and software architecture.\n\n\nRepository Strategy: Staying in QuTiP Core\nEric raised an important concern about separate repositories potentially not being maintained long term. The solution? We’ll develop directly in QuTiP core, within a new quantum_systems folder. Eric will create a development branch called dev.qsystem, and I’ll be pushing commits and PRs to this branch for testing and review.\nThis approach has several advantages:\n\nEnsures long term maintenance and integration\nMakes collaboration with the QuTiP team seamless\nProvides immediate access to QuTiP’s existing infrastructure\nFacilitates testing with the broader QuTiP ecosystem\n\n\n\nDesign Philosophy: Functions Creating Objects\nThe architectural direction became clearer this week. The main module will contain functions that create structured objects for quantum systems. I’ll be sharing a Jaynes-Cummings example for team review, which will serve as the template for other quantum models.\nThis function based approach strikes a nice balance between usability and structure, users get simple function calls, but the underlying system maintains proper object-oriented design for extensibility."

    "text": "Exploring the Rabi Model: Beyond the Rotating Wave Approximation\nWhile working on the Jaynes-Cummings implementation, I’ve been diving deep into the Rabi model, which provides fascinating insights into the fundamental atom-field interaction without approximations.\n\nThe Physics Connection\nThe Rabi model is essentially the “parent” of the Jaynes-Cummings model. Where JCM uses the rotating wave approximation to simplify the math, the Rabi model keeps all terms in the interaction:\nRabi Model Hamiltonian: H_{Rabi} = \\omega_c a^\\dagger a + \\frac{\\omega_a}{2} \\sigma_z + g(a^\\dagger + a)(\\sigma_+ + \\sigma_-)\nJaynes-Cummings Model (with RWA): H_{JC} = \\omega_c a^\\dagger a + \\frac{\\omega_a}{2} \\sigma_z + g(a^\\dagger \\sigma_- + a \\sigma_+)\nThe key difference is that the Rabi model includes the “counter-rotating” terms a^\\dagger \\sigma_+ and a \\sigma_-, which represent processes that don’t conserve energy (creating a photon while exciting the atom, or destroying a photon while de-exciting the atom).\n\n\nWhen Does the Difference Matter?\nThe rotating wave approximation is valid when g \\ll \\omega_c, \\omega_a, meaning the coupling is much weaker than the characteristic frequencies. But in several important scenarios, the Rabi model becomes essential:\n\nStrong Coupling Regime: When g approaches \\omega_c or \\omega_a\nCircuit QED: Superconducting qubits in microwave cavities often reach strong coupling\nUltrastrong Coupling: Some systems achieve g/\\omega &gt; 0.1, where the RWA completely breaks down\n\n\n\nCollapse Operators for the Rabi Model\nFor the complete open system description, the Rabi model uses the same dissipation mechanisms as JCM:\n\nCavity decay: C_1 = \\sqrt{\\kappa (1 + n)} a\nAtomic decay: C_2 = \\sqrt{\\gamma} \\sigma_-\nAtomic dephasing: C_3 = \\sqrt{\\gamma_\\phi} \\sigma_z\n\nThe master equation structure remains the same, but the Hamiltonian evolution includes the additional oscillating terms that can lead to richer dynamics.\n\n\nImplementation Considerations\nIncluding both Rabi and Jaynes-Cummings models in our library provides users with:\n\nJCM: Fast, well understood dynamics for weak coupling\nRabi: Accurate physics for strong coupling regimes\nEducational value: Direct comparison of approximations vs exact models\nResearch flexibility: Users can easily switch between models\n\nThe parameter sets are nearly identical, making it easy to implement both and let users choose based on their specific regime of interest."

I found myself wrestling with a fundamental question: should we use a modular approach with separate functions for different components, or a unified function that returns everything at once?\nThis led me to develop two different iterations of the JC model implementation, each representing a different philosophy:\n\nIteration 1: Modular Design Pattern\nThe first approach breaks down the quantum system into distinct, reusable components:\ndef build_jc_operators(n_cavity: int)\ndef build_jc_hamiltonian(n_cavity, omega_c, omega_a, g, rotating_wave, operators)\ndef build_jc_collapse_operators(operators, cavity_decay, atomic_decay, atomic_dephasing, thermal_noise)\ndef jc_latex_representation(rotating_wave)\nThis modular approach offers several advantages:\n\nFlexibility: Users can call individual functions if they only need specific components\nClarity: Each function has a single, well defined responsibility\nDebugging: Easier to test and debug individual components\n\n\n\nIteration 2: Unified Function Design\nThe second approach consolidates everything into a single function:\ndef jaynes_cummings_model(n_cavity, omega_c, omega_a, g, rotating_wave,\n                        cavity_decay, atomic_decay, atomic_dephasing, thermal_noise):\n   # Returns: operators, hamiltonian, c_ops, latex\nThis unified approach provides:\n\nSimplicity: One function call gets you everything\nConsistency: All components are guaranteed to be compatible\nConvenience: Perfect for users who want the complete system\nLess overhead: No need to pass operators between functions"

    "section": "Implementation Details and Design Choices",
    "text": "Implementation Details and Design Choices\nMost of my time this week was spent ensuring the correctness of the quantum mechanical implementations across both design patterns. Here are the key aspects I focused on:\n\nOperator Construction\nThe fundamental operators form the building blocks of any quantum system. For the JC model, I implemented:\n\nCavity operators: Photon creation/annihilation (a, a_dag) and number operator (n_c)\nAtomic operators: Pauli matrices and raising/lowering operators (sigma_plus, sigma_minus, sigma_z, sigma_x, sigma_y)\n\nEach operator is properly tensorized to work in the combined cavity-atom Hilbert space, which was crucial to get right.\n\n\nParameter Choices and Flexibility\nAfter considerable thought, I settled on the following parameter set for the JC model:\nSystem Parameters:\n\nn_cavity: Hilbert space truncation (default: 10)\nomega_c: Cavity frequency (default: 1.0)\nomega_a: Atomic frequency (default: 1.0)\ng: Coupling strength (default: 0.1)\nrotating_wave: Boolean flag for RWA vs full Rabi model (default: True)\n\nDissipation Parameters:\n\ncavity_decay: Photon leakage rate κ (default: 0.0)\natomic_decay: Spontaneous emission rate γ (default: 0.0)\natomic_dephasing: Pure dephasing rate γ_φ (default: 0.0)\nthermal_noise: Tuple (n_th, kappa) for thermal effects (default: None)\n\nThese defaults provide sensible starting points while allowing full customization for specific research needs.\n\n\nThermal Noise Implementation\nOne interesting aspect was implementing thermal noise correctly. When the cavity is coupled to a thermal bath at finite temperature, we need both absorption and emission processes:\n\nThermal absorption: Rate ∝ κ × n_th (creating photons)\nStimulated emission: Rate ∝ κ × (n_th + 1) (destroying photons)\n\nThis required careful handling of the thermal photon number n_th and the cavity decay rate.\n\n\nThe Driving Term Decision\nAn important design choice was how to handle external driving fields. Rather than building driving terms directly into our functions, I decided to keep them external. This means users can add driving terms right before when setting up their time evolution:\n# Our function provides the base system\nops, H0, c_ops, latex = jaynes_cummings_model(...)\n\n# Users add driving externally  \nH_drive = lambda t, args: driving_amplitude * (ops['a'] * np.exp(-1j * drive_freq * t) + ops['a_dag'] * np.exp(1j * drive_freq * t))\nH_total = H0 + H_drive\nThis approach maintains simplicity in our core functions while providing maximum flexibility for time-dependent problems."

Team’s suggestion to create a unified QuantumSystem class has shifted our approach from “functions that return components” to “objects that encapsulate quantum systems.”\nThe key insight from the meeting was that our output should be a class object (e.g., QuantumSystem) with methods like pretty_print() and properties like hamiltonian and c_ops. This design decision immediately clarified several architectural questions that had been lingering."

    "text": "Understanding QuTiP’s Design Patterns\nWhile reading through QuTiP’s codebase, I began to see clear patterns in how QuTiP structures its functionality:\n\nThe Qobj Pattern\nQuTiP has a general Qobj class that represents quantum objects. Rather than having separate classes for different types of quantum objects, QuTiP uses factory functions that return Qobj instances:\n# Factory functions that return Qobj instances\npsi = qt.basis(5, 2)        # Returns Qobj representing |2⟩\nbell = qt.bell_state('00')  # Returns Qobj representing Bell state\ncoherent = qt.coherent(10, 2.0)  # Returns Qobj representing coherent state\nAll of these functions return the same type (Qobj), but each represents a different quantum state with specific properties and initialization.\n\n\nThe Result Pattern\nSimilarly, QuTiP’s solvers use factory-like patterns:\nresult = qt.mesolve(H, psi0, times, c_ops)  # Returns Result instance\nThe mesolve function is essentially a factory that creates Result objects containing the evolution data."

    "text": "The Design Insight: Factory Functions + General Class\nThis led me to realize what the team has been suggesting all along: we should follow QuTiP’s established patterns by creating:\n\nA general QuantumSystem class (not abstract) that holds quantum system data\nFactory functions for each model that return QuantumSystem instances\n\nThe analogy would be:\n# Our proposed pattern\njc_system = jaynes_cummings(n_cavity=5, g=0.1)    # Returns QuantumSystem\nspin_chain = spin_chain(n_spin=8, J=0.2)          # Returns QuantumSystem  \ndicke_system = dicke_model(n_atoms=10, g=0.05)    # Returns QuantumSystem\n\n# All return the same type, but with different physics\nThis mirrors exactly how QuTiP handles quantum objects and solver results."

    "text": "Studying QuTiP’s Internal Architecture\nMy illness-induced study session revealed several important aspects of QuTiP’s design philosophy:\n\nConsistent Return Types\nQuTiP functions consistently return well-defined object types (Qobj, Result, etc.) rather than tuples or dictionaries. This provides predictable interfaces and enables method chaining.\n\n\nProperties vs Methods\nQuTiP objects use properties for data access (qobj.shape, result.states) and methods for operations (qobj.dag(), qobj.norm()). This distinction guides how we should structure our QuantumSystem interface.\n\n\nLaTeX Integration\nThe meeting notes mention that Qobj has specific methods for LaTeX printing in different environments. Understanding how QuTiP handles LaTeX representation will be crucial for our latex_representation() functionality."

Rather than rushing to add more physics models, I invested time in ensuring the existing code is robust, well tested, and maintainable.\n\nComprehensive Test Coverage\nI implemented three major test suites covering different aspects of the architecture:\ntest_quantum_system.py - Test methods covering initialization, property access, mathematical operations, and edge cases. This ensures our base QuantumSystem class handles everything from empty systems to large tensor product spaces correctly.\ntest_jaynes_cummings.py - JC implementation including parameter variations, operator relationships, Hamiltonian structure verification, dissipation mechanisms, and physics correctness. Each test targets specific aspects like commutation relations, thermal effects, and rotating wave approximation differences.\ntest_qubit.py - A test suite for the simple qubit system, covering Pauli operator properties, anticommutation relations, and basic quantum mechanics verification.\n\n\nTesting Philosophy\nThe test suites follow scientific software best practices:\n\nPhysics Verification: Tests confirm operators satisfy expected quantum mechanical relationships (commutation relations, Hermiticity, normalization)\nParameter Robustness: Parametrized tests check behavior across different parameter regimes\n\nEdge Case Coverage: Tests handle zero parameters, large systems, and boundary conditions\nIntegration Testing: Verification that components work together correctly (Hamiltonians with their operators, collapse operators with proper rates)\n\nThough this is the forst time I was writing such extensive tests for complex code and models. For this part I had to use exisisting tests from qutip codebase and chatgpt for help. Though I feel there are still some discrepancies."

Eric’s question about “why use get_x functions, just access properties directly” led to clarifying our approach.\nThe decision was to maintain both patterns:\n\nDirect access for Python, natural usage\nMethod access for QuTiP style consistency and potential future extensions\n\nThis flexibility lets users choose their preferred interaction style while maintaining compatibility with QuTiP conventions.\n\n\nSpin Model Parameter Standardization\nThe meeting highlighted the need for more standardized approaches to spin chain parameters. The feedback was to define comprehensive default dissipation channels for each spin while allowing users flexibility to customize as needed. This ensures the models are immediately useful while remaining extensible."

While it might seem less exciting than implementing new physics, comprehensive testing is essential for building reliable scientific software.\nThe testing process also validated our architectural choices. When tests for three very different quantum systems (base class, cavity QED, many-body spins, and two-level atoms) all follow similar patterns and pass consistently, it confirms we’ve found a robust abstraction.\nMost importantly, having comprehensive tests now enables faster, more confident development in future weeks. We can add new models knowing that any breaking changes will be immediately detected, and we can refactor implementations knowing the physics behavior remains correct."
