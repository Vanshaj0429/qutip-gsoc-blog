# Welcome to My GSoC 2025 Journey

Hi, I'm **Vanshaj Bindal** â€“ a MSc Physics graduate with a passion for quantum information, theoretical physics and newfound interest in open-source development. I'm thrilled to be participating in **Google Summer of Code 2025** with NumFOCUS, working on an exciting project that bridges quantum physics and computational tools.

This blog is a record of my GSoC experience, technical discoveries, and the fascinating world of quantum simulation software.

## About the Project

### Hamiltonian Library for QuTiP

I'm developing a **comprehensive Hamiltonian Library** for [QuTiP](https://qutip.org/) (Quantum Toolbox in Python), one of the most widely-used quantum simulation frameworks. Currently, QuTiP users must frequently recreate common quantum system Hamiltonians from scratch, leading to redundant work and potential inconsistencies.

**What I'm Building:**

- Ready-to-use implementations of frequently used quantum systems including Jaynes-Cummings, Rabi, Dicke, and various spin-chain models
- A standardized API with JSON serialization for cross-platform compatibility
- Time-dependent parameter support for dynamic quantum systems  
- LaTeX representation capabilities for clear mathematical documentation
- Comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and seamless integration with QuTiP's existing functionality

**Technologies & Tools:**

- **Primary:** Python, QuTiP, NumPy, SciPy
- **Development:** Git, GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks
- **Documentation:** LaTeX, Matplotlib  
- **Testing:** pytest framework

**Mentors:** Alex Pitchford, Neill Lambert, Eric Giguere and Simon Cross

This project will enhance the user experience for quantum researchers and reduce redundancy in quantum simulations.
