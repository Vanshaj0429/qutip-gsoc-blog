The community bonding period (May 10 - June 1) has almost officially wrapped up! This three-week phase was all about getting acquainted with the QuTiP community, understanding the project scope better, and laying the groundwork for a successful summer of coding.

## First Impressions and Learning from the Past

One of the first things I did was reach out to previous GSoC participants to understand what makes a successful project. Reading through their blogs and briefly examining their contributions gave me valuable insights into the scope and expectations of GSoC projects. It was fascinating to see how different contributors approached their projects, documented their progress, and overcame challenges along the way.

The variety of projects from previous years - from quantum machine learning optimization to enhancing quantum circuit diagrams - really highlighted the breadth of impact that GSoC projects can have in the scientific computing community.

## Revisiting My Foundation

I spent considerable time revisiting and refining my original proposal for the Hamiltonian Library. Having been accepted, I wanted to ensure I had a crystal-clear understanding of every aspect of what I committed to deliver. This deep dive helped me identify some of the challenges early and think about implementation strategies more thoroughly.

The proposal review also helped me break down the project into more manageable milestones and clarify the technical specifications for each quantum system I'll be implementing.

## Meeting the Team

The highlight of the community bonding period was definitely my first introductory meeting with the QuTiP team on May 23rd. Meeting Alex Pitchford, Neill Lambert, and Simon Cross was both exciting and slightly nerve-wracking! 

The team was incredibly welcoming and provided great insights into the QuTiP ecosystem. We had an in-depth discussion about the technical approach for the Hamiltonian Library, covering several key areas:

**Technical Architecture:** We discussed keeping the class hierarchy simple and clean, focusing on usability over complexity. The team emphasized the importance of identifying common patterns and similarities between different quantum models to create a coherent and intuitive API.

**Research Foundation:** There was strong agreement on the need to thoroughly research existing literature for different quantum models to ensure our implementations are both accurate and comprehensive. Starting with well-established models like the Jaynes-Cummings model and various spin models would provide a solid foundation before expanding to more complex systems.

**Portability Considerations:** An interesting discussion emerged around inter-portability of the library. While Simon and Alex advocated for maximizing cross-platform compatibility, Eric had earlier suggested to them to focus only on Python implementation initially. This highlighted the balance between ambition and practical delivery that's crucial for GSoC projects.

**Project Scope:** The team helped me understand that starting with core models and seeing where the project naturally evolves would be more valuable than trying to implement everything at once. This iterative approach would allow for better testing and refinement of the library's design.

What struck me most was how collaborative and open the discussion was - they genuinely wanted to understand my vision for the project while sharing their deep expertise in quantum simulation. 

## Sharpening Technical Skills

Knowing that the coding phase would be intensive, I dedicated time to brushing up on essential technical skills:

**Python Proficiency:** Reviewed Python concepts, particularly focusing on object-oriented design that would be crucial for building a well-structured Hamiltonian library. I dove into topics like inheritance, composition, and abstract base classes.

**Git & GitHub Workflow:** Refreshed my knowledge of collaborative development practices, including branching strategies, code review processes, and best practices for open-source contributions. This proved invaluable for contributing to a project with multiple maintainers.

**Testing with pytest:** Since robust testing would be crucial for a scientific computing library, I spent some time on some pytest features including parameterized tests, and testing strategies for numerical code.

I also dedicated some time to familiarizing myself with the QuTiP ecosystem, diving into `qutip-qip` and working through `qutip-tutorials` to understand the current state of quantum simulation tools and identify where my Hamiltonian Library would fit most naturally.

## Contributing Beyond GSoC

During this period, I also participated in **Unitary Hack 2025**, having a look at other quantum information and computing libraries and openeing a few PR. This experience was valuable - it helped me understand different codebases from a design point, hoping I might find something inspiring that could be included in my project.

Working on some of the issues helped me refine my approach to reading documentation, understanding existing code architecture, and making improvements. These skills will be directly applicable to my work on the QuTiP Hamiltonian Library.

## Looking Ahead

As we transition into the coding phase, I feel excited about the journey ahead. The community bonding period has helped me with a clearer understanding of the project scope, good communication with my mentors, refreshed technical skills, and valuable experience from contributing to other projects.

The next phase will focus on deciding the architecture and starting work on the first set of quantum system models. Following the team's guidance, I'll begin with the Jaynes-Cummings model and spin models, keeping the architecture simple while ensuring it's extensible for future quantum systems.

Stay tuned for weekly updates as we dive into the exciting world of quantum Hamiltonian implementations!
