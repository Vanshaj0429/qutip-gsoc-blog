A few months ago, I decided to apply for Google Summer of Code, hoping to contribute to an open-source project that would challenge me and make a real impact. After weeks of anticipation...

**I'm thrilled to announce that I've been selected as a Google Summer of Code 2025 contributor!** ðŸš€

## What I'll Be Working On

Here's the problem I'm helping to solve: currently, QuTiP users often need to recreate common quantum system Hamiltonians from scratch, leading to duplicated effort and potential inconsistencies. My project aims to change that by creating a comprehensive library of ready-to-use implementations.

The project will include:

- **Ready-to-use quantum system models** (Jaynes-Cummings, Rabi, Dicke, and various spin-chain models)
- **Standardized APIs** for consistency across different quantum models
- **JSON serialization** for cross-platform compatibility
- **Time-dependent parameter support** for dynamic quantum systems
- **LaTeX representation** for clear mathematical documentation

This will essentially provide researchers with a well-tested, standardized toolkit for quantum simulations, reducing redundant work and improving consistency across the field.

## Looking Forward

I'm genuinely excited about this opportunity. The selection process was competitive, and I'm grateful to have been chosen to work on something that will directly benefit the quantum computing and physics research community.

When I first submitted my application, I knew it was a long shot â€“ but I'm glad I took the chance. Now I get to spend the summer contributing to open-source software that actual researchers will use in their work.

Over the next few months, I'll be:

- Developing and testing the core Hamiltonian library components
- Learning deeper aspects of quantum mechanics and numerical methods
- Contributing to a project that will be used by researchers worldwide
- Documenting the entire development process right here on this blog

You can expect regular updates including technical insights about quantum computing and library development, challenges and solutions encountered during the project, code examples and implementation details, and reflections on contributing to open-source scientific software.

This summer promises to be an exciting blend of learning, coding, and contributing to the quantum computing community. Stay tuned!

## Acknowledgments

I want to thank the **QuTiP team** for this incredible opportunity. The mentorship and support they've already provided has been exceptional, and I'm looking forward to working closely with them throughout the summer.
