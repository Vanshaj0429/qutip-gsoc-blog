## Hello!

I'm a physicst with a passion for quantum computing and open-source software. Currently, I'm participating in **Google Summer of Code 2025**, working on developing a comprehensive Hamiltonian Library for QuTiP.

## Current Work

**Google Summer of Code 2025 Contributor**  
*May 2025 - Present*

Working with NumFOCUS on developing a Hamiltonian Library for QuTiP (Quantum Toolbox in Python). The project aims to create a standardized, comprehensive library of quantum system Hamiltonians to reduce redundant work in the quantum computing research community.

**Key contributions:**
- Developing ready-to-use implementations of common quantum systems
- Creating standardized APIs for consistency across different models
- Implementing JSON serialization for cross-platform compatibility
- Adding LaTeX representation capabilities for clear documentation

## Interests

- **Quantum Computing:** Simulation, algorithms, and practical applications
- **Open Source:** Contributing to scientific computing libraries
- **Python Development:** Scientific computing, data analysis, and automation
- **Research:** Quantum mechanics, numerical methods, and computational physics

## Technical Skills

- **Languages:** Python, Julia 
- **Quantum Computing:** QuTiP, Qiskit, quantum algorithms
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Jupyter, LaTeX, 
- **Web Development:** Quarto

## Education
